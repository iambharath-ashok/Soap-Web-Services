# Soap Webservices

## What is web services?

-	Communication b/w service provider and service consumer applications over the n/w through HTTP protocol
-	Exchange messages or data in diff formats like JSON, XML, SOAP
- 	Advantages of Webservice
	- 	Interoperability -> platform independent
	- 	Extensibility -> Can implement own logic
	- 	Loosely Coupled -> 
	- 	Mashups -> combining services or data from multiple services into one single page

## Types of webservices

- 	SOAP vs REST
- 	SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
	- 	Apps communicate through SOAP messages -> xml format
	- 	SOAP uses HTTP POST Method
- REST
	- 	REST is built on top of HTTP protocol
	- 	REST uses all the HTTP methods
	- 	REST supports various formats like JSON, XML, TEXT
	


## Java Standards for Implementing Webservices

- 	JAX-WS ->Java API for XML based webservices
	- 	JAX-WS is a standard for implementing SOAP based webservices
	
- 	JAX-RS -> Java API for RESTFull services
	-	JAX-RS is a standard for implementing RESTFull services
		
## SOA - Service Oriented Architecture

- 	Collection of Architectural Principles to design and implement the Appln
	- 	Appln in such a way that app consists of services with simple interfaces in a loosely coupled manner
	
- 	Maintained
		- 	By W3 and OASIS
		
- 	Contract b/w the services
		- 	SOAP - WSDL
		- 	REST - WADL,Swagger
		
- 	Data format
	- 	XML is the data format used b/w services in SOA for Soap based
	-	XML, JSON, TEXT data formats for REST Based

- 	Advantages
	- 	Platform Independent -> SOA apps should be platform independent
	- 	FOCUSSED Developer Roles
	- 	Loosely Coupled
	- 	Re-usability
	- 	Cost Reduction
	- 	Scalability
	- 	Availability
	
- 	Webservice implements SOA because of interoperability, Platform independent, Re-usability	
- 	SOA is set of prinicples and webservice is a way of implementing the SOA in the service or App
- 	In SOA world -> service is implementation of business logic that operates on its own
