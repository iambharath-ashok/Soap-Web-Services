# 	Java web-services Stack

- 	Provides various tools for developing the web-services
- 	web-service stack serialize and deserialize the incoming request and responses to language objects and back to xml or json formats
-	web-service Engines dispatch the incoming requests and responses to appropriate methods


## Famous web-service Stack

- 	Apache CXF
- 	Apache Axis
- 	Metro --> Glassfish
- 	Weblogic 
- 	Websphere

## Apache CXF 

- 	Most Famous web-service engine in the Java space
- 	CXF provides implementation for both JAX-RS and JAX-WS specification
- 	Using CXF both SOAP and RESTFull services can be developed

## Why Apache CXF?

- 	CXF has both SOAP and Restful engine and provides implementation for both JAX-RS and JAX-WS
- 	Serializes and De-serializes the Java objects to data formats like XML and JSON
- 	Dispatches messages to the appropriate methods
	
	Client(Request) -> Message(xml)-> web-services Engine(SOAP/REST) -> (Deserialize)JavaObjects -> (Dispatch)WS Endpoint method

	
- 	CXF implements the WS Standards
	- 	WS Security
	- 	WS Policy
	- 	Just needs to configure them

- 	CXF Provides Tools for developing producer and consumer classes
	- 	WSDL2JAVA
	- 	JAVA2WSDL
	- 	Plugin support for maven and ant

- 	CXF is supported by spring and spring boot
	- 	Easy to configure --> just needs to add the dependency

-	Extend and customize 
	- 	Using Handlers and Interceptors

- 	Current Version
	- 	3.0.3


## CXF and Spring boot
- 	Spring Boot has support for CXF
- 	cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxws dependency is used to developing the soap web-service
- 	cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxws will add CXF engine that implements the JAX-WS specification and handles all the SOAP web-service

##	Steps to create a SOAP WS with Apache CXF in springboot
	- 	Create the springboot project
	- 	add the cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxws depenedency
	- 	define or create the web-service endpoint with class and methods
		-	@WebService and @WebMethod
	- 	publish the endpoint
		- 	create the spring configuration file with
			@Configuration
		- 	define the bean for the endpoint
		- 	Inject the cxf bus to configuration class
			- 	CXF bus is runtime environment of the CXF JAX-WS
		- 	publish the endpoint
	- 	Add the context path for the app
		- 	application.properties
			- 	server.servlet.context-path=hellows
			- 	cxf.path=/
	- 	Run the application
	- 	Test with client like SoapUI
		- 	Create a Soap project
		- 	Add the wsdl 
		- 	send the request to endpoint
	
	
	
##	Creating the Soap webservice with springboot


	Code Snippet:
	
	
		@WebService
		@Features(features = "......LoggingFeature")
		public class HelloWs {
			
			@WebMethod
			public String hello() {
				
				return "hello";
			
			}
		
		}
		
		@Configuration
		public class WebServiceConfig {
		
			public Bus bus;
			@Bean
			public Endpoint createEndpoint() {
				
				Endpoint endpoint = new EndpointImpl(bus, new HelloWs());
				endpoint.publish("/hello");
				return endpoint;
			}
			
		}
	
		
		
		application.yml
		
		
			server:
				servlet:
					context-point:hellows
					
			cxf:
				path=/
	
## 	Enabling Logging Feature 

-	@Features Annotation to the @WebService Class
-	This will log Soap messages to console


	EX:
	
		@WebService
		@Features(features = "......LoggingFeature")
		public class HelloWs {
			
			@WebMethod
			public String hello() {
				
				return "hello";
			
			}
		
		}
