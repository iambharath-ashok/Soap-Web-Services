# WS Standards 

-	WS Standards are non-functional requirements that is common for most of the applications
-	Developer no needs to develop from scratch ... should know how to configure them and use them
-	WS Engines like CXF will provide the implementation for the standards
-	Some of WS Standards are Security, asynchronous communication
-	Security Standard with User Name Token 
	-	Which will enable Authentication and Authorization
-	Encryption and Decryption Standard
	-	Encrypting the soap message before sending and decrypting at server side
-	MTOM Standard
	-	Used to transfer files b/w webservices
	

##	Use Case 

-	E-Commerce Application making use of Third Party Payment Gateway to process the Payment
	
	
	
# Why WS standards

-	Provides a standard way to implement the non-functional requirement


## 1.	WS Security

###	WS Security address below problems 
	
####	1.	Authentication
			
		-	Specifies how and where the authentication details for the Request in SOAP message should be sent 
		-	WS Security is a standard for sending the Authentication details for the service provider 
		-	WS Security standard specifies that authentication details should be present in the Soap Header
		
		Authentication can be handled in 3 ways
		
			1.	User Name Token Profile
			2.	X.508 Certificates
			3.	SAML - Single Sign on to Organization multiple services
		
		
####	2.	Confidentiality
	
		-	Confidentiality can be addressed using Encryption and Decryption of Soap messages
			
####	3.	Integrity 
	
		- 	Integrity will be addressed by using XML Signature
		-	Service Requester will be Signature to the request xml 
		-	Receiver will recalculate the signature and at it's end to make sure that message is not tampered in middle of transition
		
## 2.	MTOM 

		-	MTOM is a WS Standard used for exchanging files


## 3. 	WS Addressing

		-	Used to make Asynchronous web service calls
	
## 4.	WS Policy 

## 5.	WS-Secure Conversation
