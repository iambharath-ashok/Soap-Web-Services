#WS Standards

-	WS Security can be handled using 4 different approaches

	-	Authentication
	-	Confidentiality
	-	Integrity
	-	Non-repudiation
	
- 	WS should be able to handle Security using areas:

	-	Authentication
	
		-	In WS Security Standards Authentication can be handled in 3 ways
		
			-	UserName Token Profile
			-	X 509 certificates
			-	SAML
			-	Handlers
		
	-	Confidentiality
			
		-	Encrypting credit card details while making payments
		-	Soap messages needs to be encrypted by sending and decrypted at server
		-	Confidentiality can be ensured using WS Security Standards like encryption and decryption
		
	-	Integrity
		
		-	Integrity is used to ensure that messages sent by client is same as received as it is at server
		-	Message didn't got tampered in b/w
		-	Integrity is ensured using WS Security Standard Signature
		-	Soap message will be sent with Digital Signature
		-	An Hashcode will be generated at client and it will be send as part of soap body and hashcode recalculated at server and compared to see it if both messages match
			-	then it will processed otherwise it will rejected
							
	-	Non-repudiation
	
		-	Its a replay attack 
		-	Hacker will get the sample messages and replay it millions time to crash the server
		-	WS Security standards like Timestamp can be used to avoid the replay attacks


## Apache WSS4J

-	WSS4J is a project or framework that implements WS Security standards
-	WSS4J works on concept of interceptor both on client and server side
-	WS Security Standard uses and implements WSS4J framework 
-	These WSS4J we can implement Authentication, encryption, signature and timestamp


## Confidentiality

-	Symmetric
	-	Pair of Private keys will shared b/w client and server
	-	Client will encrypt with its private key and Server will decrypt with its private key
	-	Also called as private key encryption
	-	Populare are AES
	
-	Asymmetric 
	-	Called as public key encryption
	-	Pair of public and private key will generated at server
	-	Servers public key will be shared across the different client
	-	Client will encrypt the request with public key
	-	And server will decrypt data with its private key
	-	Widely used 
	
	
-	Keystore Files
	
	-	Keystore is a file where both private and public key is stored
	-	keystore is password is protected
	-	For each private key we need to provide an alias and password 
	-	Alias is like username which we can access from application
	-	Public key can exported as an certificate and can be used across various clients
	-	Exported certificate can be imported to client keystore or truststore


-	Creating and importing keystore files

	-	Generate keystore files with private and public keys at both server and client 
	-	Export public key from jks Keystore file at both server and client
	-	Import public keys of server at client 
	-	Import public keys of client at server side 
		
		-	In this way encryption and decryption is handled at both server and client side
		

##	WSS4J Framework

	-	WSS4J framework can be used to implment UserName token profile for authentication
	-	WSS4J can be used to implement Encrypt and Decrypt the soap messages
	-	WSS4J can be used to implement signature on the soap messages
	-	WSS4J can be used  to implement timeToLive on the soap messages
