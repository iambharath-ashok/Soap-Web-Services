# SOAP WEBSERVICES


## What is Web Service?
- 	Enables seamless communication b/w the applications running on different plafforms over the Internet.



## SOAP Advantages 

- 	Platform Independent and Technology Independent
	- 	HTTP -> Transport Independent 
	- 	XML -> Data Independent
	- 	As long as App has support for HTTP and XML it can be service consumer and service provider
- 	Extensibility or Customization
- 	Reusability and Cost Reduction
- 	Legacy Applications  are Great
- 	Opens up Door for new Revenue and Profit Channels
	- 	Charge per use
- 	Firewalls like Webservice
	- 	HTTP is very friendly with Firewalls
	- 	HTTP communicates through port 80
	- 	HTTPS communicates through port 443
	- 	Usually in an organizations port 80 is not blocked
	- 	Since port 80 is not blocked its very easy to use webservices inside and outside the organizations

## SOAP Disadvantages

 - 	Ambiguous Webservice standards - due to people from different mindsets and diff organizations
 - 	Performance degradation due to serialization and deserialization of SOAP messages
	- 	Every time SOAP messages needs to convert to Language specific Objects and vice versa
 - 	Consumes more Network Bandwidth due to huge payload
 - 	SOAP request and response messages have some overhead compared to REST request and response messages

 
## When to SOAP Webserives?
- 	When Formal Contract needs to be defined b/w the Webservice provider and consumer
- 	When Architecture requires non-functional requirements like Security and Transaction Management
- 	Non-Functional requirements like Transaction Management and Security comes along with Web Service Engines like Apace CXF
- 	Developers needs to know how to configure and use them

## SOAP

- 	SOAP is specification from W3C and current version is 1.2
- 	W3C specifies what are the elements that can be used on SOAP request and response messages
- 	SOAP:ENVELOPE is root element of SOAP messages and encapsulates the soap header and soap body
- 	SOAP:HEADER and SOAP:BODY are the child elements of the SOAP:ENVELOPE

		<soap:Envelope>
			<soap:header></soap:header>
			<soap:Body>
				<creditCard>
					<expireDate></expireDate>
				</creditCard>
			</soap:Body>
		<soap:Envelope>	

- 	SOAP:HEADER contains header info's like authentication
- 	SOAP:BODY contains actual request and response payloads
- 	SOAP:FAULT is an optional element and child element of soap body which will be returned when an exception occurs 
- 	SOAP:FAULT will have soap:code and soap:reason as the child element
- 	soap:code will have the soap fault code soap:reason for the exception
		
		<soap:Envelope>
			<soap:Body>
				<soap:Fault>
					<soap:code>soap:Server<soap:code>
					<soap:Reason>
						<soap:Text>
							Credit Card Expire
						</soap:Text>
					</soap:Reason>
				</soap:Fault>
			</soap:Body> 
		</soap:Envelope>
		
- SOAP Header with security	element
	<soap:Envelope>
		<soap:Header>
			<wsse:Security>
				<wsse:UsernameToken>
					<wsse:Username></wsse:Username>
					<swsse:Password></wsse:Password>
			</wsse:Security>
		</soap:Header>	
	</soap:Envelope>


## WSDL

- 	WSDL is not meant for human reading
- 	Webservice Definition Language
- 	WSDL is contract b/w service provider and consumer
- 	WSDL is a XML file with .WSDL extension
- 	WSDL provides details about
	- 	What this webservice provides
	- 	How to consume the Webservices
	
- 	WSDL file is divided into two parts
	- 	Abstract ---> WHAT
		- 	Definitions
			- 	Types -> Request and Response
			- 	Message -> params and result(return)
			- 	Operation -> methods and also the webservice
			- 	Porttype -> container of all the webservices in the WSDL
	- 	Physical ---> HOW
		- 	Binding Style -> What type of binding needs to use --:> default DOCUMENT TYPE LITERAL WRAPPED
		- 	Service -> specifies the URL and end point to consume the webserice 
	
## SOAP Binding Style

- 	SOAP Binding style will have impact 3 things
		1. SOAP Payload --> How the payload looks like ---> message inside the soap body looks like
		2. Validation -> Whether the entire SOAP body can be validated against the schema in WSDL
		3. Operation Name in SOAP message body --> webservice method that needs to invoke will be the soap message body or payload
		

		
## SOAP Binding Style 
		1. RPC/literal
		2. RPC/encoded
		3. DOCUMENT/literal
		4. DOCUMENT/encoded
